# Elixing Elixir

I made this theme especially to work with Elixir. As I'm colorblind, this helps me a lot since it has very distinct colors for pretty much every different element on your screen.

This was heavily inspired by [Night Wolf Theme](https://github.com/mao-santaella-rs/NightWolfTheme/tree/master).
